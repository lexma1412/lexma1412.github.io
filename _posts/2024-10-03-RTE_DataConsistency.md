# Data Consistency 
Concurrent accesses to shared data memory can cause data inconsistencies.
In general this must be taken into account when several code entities accessing the same data memory are running in different contexts - in other words when systems using parallel (multicore) or concurrent (singlecore) execution of code are designed. 
More general: Whenever task context-switches occur and data is shared between tasks or ISR2s, data consistency is an issue.</br> 
AUTOSAR systems use operating systems according to the AUTOSAR-OS specification which is derived from the OSEK-OS specification. The Autosar OS specification defines a priority based scheduling to allow event driven systems. This means that tasks with higher priority levels or ISR2s are able to interrupt (preempt) tasks with lower priority level.

![Data inconsistency example from RTE Autosar](https://github.com/lexma1412/lexma1412.github.io/blob/main/assets/RTE_DataConsistency/example.png?raw=true)

The inconsistencies of data can happen in following interaction/communication cases: 


| **Number** | **Case** | **Description** | **Prevention Mechanism** |  
|:--:|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **1** | Communication within one atomic AUTOSAR SW-C | Communication between Runnables of one atomic AUTOSAR SW-C running in different task/ISR2 contexts, where data is commonly accessed. If RTE support is needed for data consistency, the use of "ExclusiveAreas" or "InterRunnableVariables" is required. | - ExclusiveAreas (Interrupt blocking, OS resources)<br/>- InterRunnableVariables (Copy strategy with implicit behavior)<br/>- Sequential scheduling strategy<br/>- Task blocking strategy |  
| **2** | Intra-partition communication between AUTOSAR SW-Cs | Sender/Receiver (S/R) communication between Runnables of different AUTOSAR SW-Cs using implicit or explicit data exchange, realized by RTE through shared RAM. The same applies to Client/Server (C/S) communication. Data access collisions must be avoided by the RTE. | - Copy strategy (RTE implicit write/read port behavior) |  
| **3** | Inter-Partition communication | The RTE guarantees data consistency. | - Inter-partition communication via IOC<br/>- Basic Software Scheduler<br/>- Accessing (Ld)Com, Det, NvM in multicore/multipartition configurations<br/>- Trusted Functions, Memory Protection, Pointer Parameters in RTE API |  
| **4** | Intra-ECU communication between AUTOSAR SW-Cs and BSW modules with AUTOSAR interfaces | This is a special case of the above two scenarios. | Refer to the above two cases. |  
| **5** | Inter-ECU communication | COM guarantees data consistency in communication between ECUs throughout the entire path. The RTE ensures no data inconsistency when invoking COM send/receive calls, especially when queuing is used since the queues are provided by the RTE and not by COM. | No specific mechanism mentioned |


Let go through each mechanism in following sections. 

## Exclusive Areas 
As mention above, Exclusive Areas is used to prevent Data Inconsistency between Runnables of one atomic AUTOSAR SW-C running in different task/ISR2 contexts, also for the Basic Software Modules want to protect its inside data against multi API access. The concept of ExclusiveArea is more a working model, it is not a particular mechanism.
**Focus of the ExclusiveArea concept is to block potential concurrent accesses to get data consistency. ExclusiveAreas implement critical section.** 
* If an AUTOSAR SW-C requests the RTE to look for data consistency for itâ€™s internally used data:  use the API calls "Rte_Enter()" and "Rte_Exit() defines the begin and the end of the code sequence containing data accesses the RTE. Similar for Basic Software Module, but it uses "SchM_Enter() and "SchM_Exit()". 
E.g: Runnable_1 want to access resource Y exclusively 

``` 
Runnable_1():   
Rte_Enter()   
Access (read/modify/write) resource Y   
Rte_Exit() 
``` 
* If the SW designer wants to have the mutual exclusion for complete RunnableEntitys: can specify this by using the ExclusiveArea in the role "runsInside" in the AUTOSAR SW-C description. <br/>
Basic Software Module does not support case runinside ExclusiveArea. The assignment data consistency mechanism of ExclusiveArea is configure via **RteExclusiveAreaImplMechanism** parameter with value: ALL_INTERRUPT_BLOCKING/OS_INTERRUPT_BLOCKING/OS_RESOURCE/OS_SPINLOCK/NONE/RTE_PLUGIN corresponding with Interrupt blocking strategy/Usage of OS resources mechanism. 

## InterRunnableVariables
InterRunnableVariables mechanism is one kind of copy strategy and be used to guarantee data consistency for communication between Runnables of one AUTOSAR. Simply, when exchange global data between Runnables,we need make sure the data inconsistency problem not happen.<br/>

InterRunnableVariables have a behavior corresponding to Sender/Receiver communication between AUTOSAR SW-Cs (or rather between Runnables of different AUTOSAR SW-Cs). <br/>
But why not use Sender/Receiver communication directly instead? Purpose is data encapsulation / data hiding. Access to InterRunnableVariables of an AUTOSAR SW-C from other AUTOSAR SWCs is not possible and not supported by RTE. InterRunnableVariable content stays SW-C internal and so no other SW-C can use it. Especially not misuse it without understanding how the data behaves<br/>


InterRunnableVariables has 2 types:
1. **InterRunnableVariables with implicit behavior (implicitInterRunnableVariable)**: Focus of InterRunnableVariable with implicit behavior is to avoid concurrent accesses by redirecting second, third, accesses to data item copies.<br/>
-The Runnable IN data is stable during Runnable execution, which means that during an Runnable execution several read accesses to an implicitInterRunnableVariable always deliver the same data item value. <br/>
-The Runnable OUT data is forwarded to other Runnables not before Runnable execution has terminated, which means that during an Runnable execution write accesses to implicitInterRunnableVariable are not visible to other Runnables.

```
; example
; Runnable_1: run in task 10ms, read InterRunnableVariable_1
; Runnable_2: run in task 10ms, read InterRunnableVariable_1
; Runnable_3: run in task 5ms, write InterRunnableVariable_1
SWC():
    struct Irvdata1 = {
        &R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R1 ; copy data to be used Runnable_1
        &R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R2 ; copy data to be used of Runnable_2
        &W_InterRunnableVariable_1_R3 ; data to be written by Runnable_3, W_InterRunnableVariable_1_R3 always equal to InterRunnableVariable_1
    }
    Runnable_1(): ; Runnable_1
        data_1=Rte_IrvIRead_InterRunnableVariable_1() ; read InterRunnableVariable_1, data_1 = &R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R1
        ... do something with data_1 
    
    Runnable_2(): ; Runnable_2
        data_2=Rte_IrvIRead_InterRunnableVariable_1() ; read InterRunnableVariable_1, data_2 = &R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R2
        ... do something with data_2
        ...
        data_3=Rte_IrvIRead_InterRunnableVariable_1() ; read InterRunnableVariable_1, data_2 = &R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R2, data_3 equal to data_2 
        ... do something with data_3

    Runnable_3(): ; Runnable_3
        ...
        Rte_IrvIWrite_InterRunnableVariable_1(data) ; at the end of Runnable_3, write data to W_InterRunnableVariable_1_R3

Task_10ms():

    R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R1 = W_InterRunnableVariable_1_R3 ; copy data before call Runnable_1
    Runnable_1(): ; Task_10ms Call Runnable_1

    R_InterRunnableVariable_1_R2 = W_InterRunnableVariable_1_R3 ; copy data before call Runnable_2
    Runnable_2(): ;Task_10ms Call Runnable_2

Task_5ms():
    Runnable_3(): ; Task_10ms Call Runnable_3
    
```

2. **InterRunnableVariables with explicit behavior (explicitInterRunnableVariable)**: Focus of InterRunnableVariables with explicit behavior is to block potential concurrent accesses to get data consistency.<br/>
-This mechanism is similar to Exclusive Areas, however autosar define with scope of inside one SWC only for convenient use.<br/>

```
SWC():
    Global InterRunnableVariable_1 // global data
    Runnable_1():
        data_1 = Rte_IrvWrite_InterRunnableVariable_1(data) ; write data to InterRunnableVariable_1

    Runnable_2():
        data_2 = Rte_IrvRead_InterRunnableVariable_1() ; read data from InterRunnableVariable_1
```

-**Actual experience**: In my experience when working with ETAS ISOLAR RTE, explicitInterRunnableVariable cannot be guaranteed if it is read-modify-write by one runnable, it means ETAS ISOLAR RTE does not provide solution or mechanism by itself to resolve the data consistency problem in RTE. In this case, ETAS ISOLAR RTE suggest users to implement Exclusive Areas by themselves instead.

|InterRunnableVariables with implicit behavior|InterRunnableVariables with explicit behavior|
|:----|:----|
|- In applications with very high SW-C communication needs and much real time constraints (like in powertrain domain) the usage of a copy mechanism to get data consistency might be a good choice because during RunnableEntity execution no data consistency overhead in form of concurrent access blocking code and runtime during its execution exists.- independent of the number of data item accesses. <br/> - Disadvantage is RAM can be high due to variable copy.          |-Application require to have access to the newest data item value without any delay, even several times during execution of a Runnable. <br/>-Focus of InterRunnableVariables with explicit behavior is to block potential concurrent accesses to get data consistency.<br/> - Disadvantage is timing constraint.|


## Other mechanisms
* Sequential scheduling strategy:<br/>
-The activation code of Runnables is sequentially placed in one task/ISR2 so that
no interference between them is possible because one Runnable is only activated
after the termination of the other. Data consistency is guaranteed. In other words, it is just the way to put the runnable in one task with order, depend on design.
```
Task_001():
    Runnable_1():
        Access read/write data_1
    Runnable_2():
        Access read/write data_1
```
* Interrupt blocking strategy:<br/>
-Interrupt blocking can be an appropriate means if collision avoidance is required for a very short amount of time. This might be done by disabling respectively suspending all interrupts, Os interrupts only or - if hardware supports it - only
of some interrupt levels. In general this mechanism must be applied with care because it might influence SW in tasks with higher priority too and the timing of the complete system.
* Usage of OS resources:<br/>
-Usage of OS resources. Advantage in comparison to Interrupt blocking strategy is that less SW parts with higher priority are blocked. Disadvantage is that
implementation might consume more resources (code, runtime) due to the more
sophisticated mechanism. Appropriateness of this mechanism may vary depending on the number of OSs/cores and/or the number of available resources.
* Task blocking strategy:<br/>
-Mutual task preemption is prohibited. This might be reached e.g. by assigning
same priorities to affected tasks, by assigning same internal OS resource to affected tasks or by configuring the tasks to be non-preemptive. This mechanism may be inappropriate in multi-partitioned systems.

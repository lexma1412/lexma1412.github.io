# Unified Diagnositc Severice (UDS)
- In automotive industry, to analyze the vehicle when it on operation or when your car has problem
and you get it to gagrage.
Therefore, the standadized protocol is created as UDS and defined in ISO 14229-1

## UDS with OSI layer
- According to 
- In this post, we focus on UDS with CAN only

## UDS Request Frame format
### Sevice ID (SID)
ID of service, range from 0x00..0x3E
### Sub-function byte:
Some SID suport sub-function that is a specific request action. 1st bit of Sub function byte has special meanning;
*   0‘ = FALSE: the ECU shall send a response, that is, no suppression of a positive response shall be done
*   1‘ = TRUE: Suppression of the positive response, that is, the ECU must not send a positive response
Negative responses shall be send by the ECU independent of this bi
### Request Data Parameters: 
can be DID, DTC. 
*   DID is stand for <b>Data Identifier</b>, it usually is static data store in advance in ECU memory, it is read by SID=0x22(readDataByIdentifier) e.g: ECU Purchase Part Number. The definition list of DID can be found in Annex C-ISO14229-1. OEM can define their own DID support list base on standard.
*   DTC is stand for <b>Diagnoistic Trouble Code</b>, DTC stores  event that satisfy error condition happenning in ECU. DTC denifition is not standardized, so it is defined specifily by OEM.
*   Snapshot data: it is a diagnostic data collected at a specific point of time. Smapshot data is useful for diagnosting fault of vehicle since it can provide condition at the time fault occur. E.g: TimeStamp, Odometer, cabin tempurature,..

## UDS Response Frame format
### Negative/Positive Response Service ID
*   In case sever/ECU is repsone normally, <b>Response SID = (Request SID + 0x40)</b>
*       In case error happen, e.g SID is not support, <b>Response SID = 0x7F</b>

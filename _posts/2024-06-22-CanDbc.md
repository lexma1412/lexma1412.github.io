# CAN Database (CAN dbc)
This post briefly summrizes some important points when working with Can dbc file. Can dbc contains rich information of message and signal sent on Can bus.<br />

There are many tool can be used to read dbc and dislay dbc visually, usually we use Candb++ tool to work with dbc and also along with Canoe tool to analyze Can bus in automotive industry. Therefore, this post also mention about useful information or guideline can be used in Candb++ tool .

## Dbc syntax

## Byte and Bit Order in dbc

**Byte order**: there are 2 kind are Motorola (Big Endian) and Intel (Little Endian) format, it impacts to sending/receiving byte sequence on CAN bus.<br/>
1. Big Endian: MSB...LSB
1. Little Endian: LSB...MSB

**Bit order**: only one format msb...lsb <br/>

In Vector CANdb++, the visual layout of message (contain multiple signals) can make confusing because different type of dislay format supported by tool:

|Repsentation Format|Start Position|Progression|Bit indication|
|:----------------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
|Intel standard         |lsb of LSB from beginning of message|bitwise to the left, bytewise to the right|in the byte from the right to the left|
|Intel sequential       |lsb of LSB from beginning of message|bitwise to the left, bytewise to the right|in the byte from the left to the right|
|Motorola Forward LSB   |lsb of LSB from beginning of message|bitwise to the left, bytewise to the left (from the start position in the direction of beginning of the message)|in the byte from the right to the left|
|Motorola Forward MSB   |msb of MSB from beginning of message|bitwise to the right, bytewise to the left (from the start position in the direction of beginning of the message)|in the byte from the right to the left|
|Motorola Backward      |lsb of LSB from end of message      |bitwise to the left, bytewise to the left (from the start position in the direction of beginning of the message)|in the byte from the right to the left|
|Motorola Sequential    |msb of MSB from beginning of message|bitwise to the right, bytewise to the right (from the start position in the direction of end of the message)|in the byte from the left to the right|

**Bit indication** here is the way to index bit of byte from msb to lsb, there are 2 way:
* from the right to the left: |7 6 5 .. 1 0 | 15 14 13 .. 8| (msb index is 7 and 15)
* from the left to the right: |0 1 2 .. 6 7 | 8 9 10 .. 15| (msb index is 0 and 8)

In simple word, we must care start position of signal is different in  each format. Example messge length = 4 bytes , signal length = 12 bit:

* Intel standard, start position of signal = 12

|7  |6  |5  |4  |3  |2  |1  |0  |   |

|msb|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|**2**  |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |**3**  |

* Intel Sequential, start position of signal = 11

* Motorola Forward LSB, start position of signal = 16

|<--|---|---|---|---|---|---|lsb|**2**  |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |**3**  |

* Motorola Backward, start position of signal = 8: count from byte number 3 and goback 8 bit.

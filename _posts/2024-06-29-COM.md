# I. Communication (COM)
COM is module placed between user (RTE, SwCluC) and PduR, it provides features to transmit/received signal to/from I-PDU, after processing, COM continue to send I-PDU to PduR.<br/>

Signal is sent from RTE/SwCluC to COM I-PDU, one I-PDU contains multiple signal.

## 1. Transmission of I-PDU

In Transmission of I-PDU from COM to lower layer (PduR), we consider:
- Transmission Mode (for I-PDU)

beside that, sent signal from upper layer to COM also need to be considered:
- Transmission Property (for sent **signal** from RTE to COM)
- Transmission Filtering (for sent **signal** from RTE to COM)

### 1.1 Transmission Mode of I-PDU

Transmission Mode of I-PDU is a group (container) of many attributes (parameter). Transmission Mode is configured for PDU via container **ComTxMode** . Transmission Mode mode (sound strange!!!) is configured via parameter **/ComTxMode/TxModeMode**

|Transmission Mode mode  |Description   |
|:----------------------|:-------------|
|DIRECT|I-Pdu is transmitted immediately (within the next main function at the latest)|
|PERIODIC|I-Pdu is transmitted  with the specified cyclic time by parameter **ComTxModeTimePeriod**|
|MIXED|Combination of CYCLIC and DIRECT|
|NONE|COM does not transmit the I-PDU. The transmission must be triggered by the lower layer through Com_TriggerTransmit()|

* **Selection of the Transmission Mod (TMC)**: This is a configuration method, it provide a way to select transmission mode for each I-PDU. According to AUTSOAR COM, there are 2 transmission mode options for each PDU: Mode True(ComTxModeTrue) and Mode False(ComTxModeFalse). Each option will it own Transmission Mode (ComTxMode container is child of ComTxModeTrue/ComTxModeFalse).The evaluation TMC is True or False based on filtering of signals belong to corresponding PDU.

* **Minimum Delay Time (MDT)**: is optional mechanism for Tx-Pdu has Transmission Property except NONE. It define as the minimum time between 2 I-PDU transmission to lower layer (PduR). If more than one transmission request before MDT expires, sent the last value updated will be sent. This mechanism can be disable when **/ComGeneral/ComEnableMDTForCyclicTransmission = false** for cyclic(=PERIODIC) PDU and cyclic(=MIXED) part of I-PDU.

* **Repetition**: is optional mechanism for Tx-Pdu. It define number of times I-PDU is sent repeatedly via PudR_ComTransmit(). The number of times is set via **ComTxModeNumberOfRepetitions** with with period between 2 repetition times is set via **ComTxModeRepetitionPeriod**, This mechanism is for direct(=DIRECT) PDU and non-cyclic(=MIXED) part of I-PDU.

* **Retry Fail Transmission Request**:  is optional mechanism for Tx-Pdu. It evaluates PduR_ComTransmit return value. If the return value of PduR_ComTransmit() is not equal to E_OK, the AUTOSAR COM Module shall invoke PduR_ComTransmit() for the not sent I-PDU again within the next Com_MainFunctionTx. To enable, set parameter **ComRetryFailedTransmitRequests** to True.

### 1.2 Transmission Property of signal

Transmission property of signal/signal group indicates the I-PDU trigger condition transmission. It is configured via parameter **/ComSignal/ComTransferProperty**
|Transmission Property  |Description   |
|:----------------------|:-------------|
|TRIGGERED|Send request of a signal/signal group trigger the transmission of I-PDU immediately (within the next main function at the latest)|
|TRIGGERED_WITHOUT_REPETION| Similar to TRIGGERED but without repetition mechanism|
|TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE|Send request of a signal/signal group trigger the transmission of I-PDU immediately if value of new sent signal/group signal differs to the locally stored (last sent or init value)|
|TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE_WITHOUT_REPETITION| Similar TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE but without repetition mechanism|

TRIGGERED_WITHOUT_REPETION, TRIGGERED_ON_CHANGE_WITHOUT_REPETITION enable the ability to disable Repetition mechanism of I-PDU for single signal.

* **Transmission Deadline Monitoring**:  This mechanism define the timeout for transmission notification from lower layer to COM. The timeout timer start from the time COM send the I-PDU transmission request to the time COM is notified(by invoking Com_TxConfirmation()).

* **Signal Processing on Transmission**:  This mechanism is configured via parameter **ComIPduSignalProcessing**. It can have the value IMMEDIATE or DEFERRED. IMMEDIATE means user notification callback function Com_CbkTxAck (to upper layer Rte) are called within the functions Com_TxConfirmation(). DEFERRED means user notification callback function are called on task level during the next call cycle of the respecitve Com_MainFunctionTx().

* **Signal Invalidation**: TBD

### 1.3 Transmission Filtering of signal

Transmission Filtering provides an evaluation to sent signal from upper layer (RTE) to COM. Simply, we can reject/accept signals that sent from RTE base on filtering condition. It is configured via parameter **/ComFilter/ComFilterAlgorithm**

|Filter Alg  |Description   |
|:----------------------|:-------------|
|ALWAYS| always TRUE|
|NEVER| always FALSE|
|MASKED_NEW_DIFFERS_MASKED_OLD| ((new & mask) \!\= (old & mask))|
|MASKED_NEW_EQUALS_X| ((new \& mask) \=\= x)|
|MASKED_NEW_DIFFERS_X| ((new \& mask) \!\= x)|
|NEW_IS_OUTSIDE| ((new < min) \|\| (max < new))|
|NEW_IS_WITHIN| ((min \<\= new) \&\& (new \<\= max))|
